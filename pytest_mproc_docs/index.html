<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to <em>pytest_mproc</em>, a plugin for pytest to run distributed testing via multiprocessing.  This manner
of distributed testing has several advantages, including more efficient execution over pytest-xdist in many cases.</p>
<p>To begin using pytest_mproc, just install:</p>
<p>% pip install pytest-mproc</p>
<p><em>pytest_mproc</em> is usable in the context of a single host with multiple cores, as well as execution across a distributed
set of machines.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-use-pytest-mproc-over-pytest-xdist">
<h1>Why Use <em>pytest_mproc</em> over <em>pytest-xdist</em>?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-use-pytest-mproc-over-pytest-xdist" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Why not just use <em>xdist</em>, another parallelization mechanism for test execution? <em>xdist</em> works for cases perhaps
where there are large number of tests, but the cost of overhead in using rsync and
overall implementation prevents realization of test-execution-time gains that one might hope for.  <em>xdist</em> also
does not provide a way to run distributed on multiple machines</p>
<p><em>pytest_mproc</em> has several advantages over xdist, depending on your situation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Overhead firing startup is much less, and start-up time does not grow with increasing number of cores as in xdist</p></li>
<li><p>It uses a pull model, so that each worker pulls the next test from a master queue, with no need to figure
out how to divide the tests beforehand.  The disadvantage is that optimal efficiency requires knowledge to
prioritize longer running tests first.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides a ‘global’ scoped test fixture to provide a single instance of a fixture across all tests, regardless of
how many nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>It provide a ‘node’ scoped test fixture that is a single instance across all workers on a single machine (node)</p></li>
<li><p>It allows you to programatically group together a bunch of tests to run serially on a single worker process</p></li>
<li><p>Support for execution across multiple machines</p></li>
<li><p>It provides a better mechanism for prioritizing and configuring test execution</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="usage">
<h1>Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>To use with pytest, you use the -C or equivalently –cores argument to specify how many cores to run on:</p>
<p>% pytest –cores 3 [remaining arguments]</p>
<p>or to specify use of all available cores:</p>
<p>% pytest –cores auto [remaining arguments]</p>
<p>You can also specify things like “auto*2” or “auto/2” for number of cores.  This is all that is needed
to get started with the minimal configuration for <em>pytest_mproc</em> – running tests on multiple cores on a single machine.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>Oversubscribing CPUs will cause additional overhead.  <em>pytest_mproc</em> kicks off all worker threads up front, and
each worker does identical processing to independently come up with the list of tests.  When the number of
threads is less than or equal to the number of cores (“a batch”), this adds little overhead.  Once beyond that, each
additional (partial) batch will add more overhead, as the CPU must be split across multiple threads for some or all
cores.</p>
</div>
<p>When going beyond the simple one-machin parallelization, certain terminology is used.  The term ‘node’ is used to
refer to a single machine within a group of machines (over which execution is distributed).  The term ‘main node’
refers to the orchestrator of the tests, responsible for overseeing test execution and reporting results to the
user.  The term ‘worker’ is used to specify a single process running on a node that is doing the actual test
execution.  The main node can distrbitue tests acros multiple other nodes, with multiple worker processes executing
within each node.</p>
<section id="disabling-pytest-mproc-from-command-line">
<h2>Disabling <em>pytest_mproc</em> from Command Line<a class="headerlink" href="#disabling-pytest-mproc-from-command-line" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To disable mproc (overriding all other pytest-mproc-related flags), specify “–diable-mproc True” on the command line.
Running without the –cores option will also run as normal, with no invocations of pytest_mproc features.</p>

</section>
<section id="grouping-tests">
<h1>Grouping Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#grouping-tests" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>By default all tests are assumed independently runnable and isolated from one another, and the order in which they
run within which process does not matter.  To group tests that must run serially within the
same process/thread, annotate each test using a unique name for the group:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pytest_mproc</span>
<span class="n">TEST_GROUP1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;group1&quot;</span>

<span class="nd">@pytest_mproc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">group</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TEST_GROUP1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_something1</span><span class="p">():</span>
     <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="nd">@pytest_mproc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">group</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TEST_GROUP1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_something2</span><span class="p">():</span>
     <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Likewise, you can use the same annotation on test class to group all test methods within that class:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pytest_mproc</span>

<span class="n">TEST_GROUP_CLASS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;class_group&quot;</span>

<span class="nd">@pytest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mproc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">group</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TEST_GROUP_CLASS</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_method1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
       <span class="k">pass</span>

       <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is useful if the tests are using a common resource for testing and parallelized execution of tests might
result in interference.</p>
<p>Groups can also be specified as class <em>pytest_mproc.data.GroupTag</em> instead of a string, to prioritize the whole group
and restrict the group to running within a single worker or withtin a single node machine:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pytest_mproc</span>

<section id="configuring-test-execution-of-groups">
<h2>Configuring Test Execution of Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-test-execution-of-groups" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As discussed below, <em>pytest_mproc</em> allows execution across multiple machines/independent processes.  There are two
ways to specify how a group of tests will be executed by using the <em>restrict_to</em> parameter of the
<em>pytest_mproc.group</em> decorator.  This can take one of two values.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><em>pytest_mproc.TestExecutionConstraint.SINGLE_PROCESS</em> - this is the default value.  This specifies that the tests
are to run serially based on priority of tests within the group on a single core</p></li>
<li><p><em>pytest_mproc.TestExecutionConstraint.SINGLE_NODE</em>  - This specifies that the group of tests are to run on a single
node of the system, but within that node the set of tests can be distributed among the workers of that node</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If specifying <em>SINGLE_NODE</em> execution in the context of running a single <em>pytest</em> process (and therefore a single node),
the only value provided is the ability to specify a hierarchy of priorities.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="a-matter-of-priority">
<h1>A Matter of Priority<a class="headerlink" href="#a-matter-of-priority" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>You can also specify a priority for test execution using the <em>pytest_mproc.priority</em> decorator:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pytest_mproc</span>

<span class="nd">@pytest_mproc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">priority</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pytest_mproc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DEFAULT_PRIORITY</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_function</span><span class="p">():</span>
   <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Groups with lower integer priority value are scheduled before those with a higher priority value.  Thus, a
group with priority <em>pytest_mproc.DEFAULT_PRIORITY-1</em> will be scheduled before a group with priority
<em>pytest_mproc.DEFAULT_PRIORITY-2</em>.  Of course, the default priority of <em>pytest_mproc.DEFAULT_PRIORITY</em>  is used if
unspecified.</p>
<p>Priorities should be specified to the default priority assigned to all tests without decorators, which can be
obtained through the variable <em>pytest_mproc.DEFAULT_PRIORITY</em>.  When working with grouped tests as explained above,
the priorities are scoped.  That is, at a global level, the priority of a group of tests will determine that group’s
execution order relative to all other top-level tests or test groups. For tests within a group, the priority of each test
will determine the order of execution only within that group.  <em>pytest_mproc</em> does not guarantee order of
execution for tests or test groups with the same priority.</p>
<p>If you specify a priority on a class of tests, all test methods within that class will have that priority, unless
a specific priority is assigned to that method through its own decorator.  In that class, the decorator for the class
method is used.</p>
</section>
<section id="globally-scoped-fixtures">
<h1>Globally Scoped Fixtures<a class="headerlink" href="#globally-scoped-fixtures" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>pytest_mproc</em> uses multiprocessing module to achieve parallel concurrency.
This raises interesting behaviors when using <em>pytest</em> and ‘session’ scoped fixtures.
For multiple-process execution, Each subprocess that is launched will create its own
session-level fixture;  in other words,  a session in the context of <em>pytest</em> is a per-process concept,
with one session-level fixture for each process.  ‘session’ becomes a misnomer in <em>pytest</em> in this way as the term
was not conceived with parallelization in mind.  This is often not obvious to test developers.
At times, a global fixture is needed, with a
single instantiation across all processes and tests.  An example might be setting up a single test database.
(NOTE: when running on more than one machine, also see ‘node-level’ fixtures discussed below)</p>
<p>To achieve this, <em>pytest_mproc</em> adds a ‘global’ scope feature, instantiated only once and shared with all nodes.
Behind the scenes, the system uses pythons <em>multiprocessing</em>
module’s BaseManager to provide this feature.  This is mostly transparent to the developer, with one notable exception.
In order to communicate a fixture globally across multiple <em>Process</em> es, the object returned (or yielded) from a
globally scoped fixture must be ‘picklable’.  To declare a fixture global:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pytest</span>

    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The global fixture is the highest level above ‘session’ in the hierarchy.  That means that globally scoped fixtures can only
depend on other globally scoped fixtures.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Values returned or yielded from a global fixture must be picklable so as to be shared across multiple

</div>
<p>Global fixtures can be passed any keyword args supported by <em>pytest.fixture</em> EXCEPT autouse.</p>
<p><em>pytest_mproc</em> guarantees that all fixtures are in place before worker clients in other processes access them, so as
not to cause a race condition.</p>
</section>
<section id="node-scoped-fixtures">
<h1>Node-scoped Fixtures<a class="headerlink" href="#node-scoped-fixtures" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>With the system now allowing execution of multiple workers on a single machine, and execution across multiple machines,
this introduces another level of scoping of fixtures:  <em>node</em>-scoped fixtures.  A node-level fixture is
instantiated once per node and such instance is only available to workers (aka all test processes) on that specific node.</p>
<p>To declare a fixture to be scoped to a node, which declares the optional autouse:</p>

<section id="a-safe-tmpdir-fixture">
<h1>A Safe <em>tmpdir</em> Fixture<a class="headerlink" href="#a-safe-tmpdir-fixture" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>pytest_mproc</em> provides its own fixtures for creating temporary directories: <em>mp_tmpdir_factory</em>, a fixture with a
“<em>create_tmpdir</em>” method for creating multiple temporary directories within a test procedure, and a
<em>mp_tmpdir</em> directory for creating a single temporary directory.  Other plugins providing similar featurs can have
race conditions causing intermittent (if infrequent) failures.  This plugin guarantees to be free of race conditions
and safe in the context of <em>pytest_mproc</em>’s concrurrent test framework.</p>
<p>(the regular pytest tmpdir and corresponding factory fixtures have a race condition that can cause a tmp dir to
be removed that is in use by another thread worker in any distributed execution)</p>

<h1>Advanced: Testing on a Distributed Set of Machines<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-testing-on-a-distributed-set-of-machines" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>pytest_mproc</em> has support for running test distributed across multiple machines.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>You should validate that your test code does not have any top-level errors before running distributed,
as common errors will be replicated and shown in the output for all workers, potentially overwhelming the log.</p>
</div>
<p>The concept is that one node will act as the main node, which is what the user launches to start the tests. That
node populates the queue of tets, and collects and reports test status. The other nodes are worker nodes (either
launched automatically or manually) and are responsible for pull tests  (or batches of tests explicitly grouped)
one-by-one until the test queue is exhausted, executing each test as it is pulled, returning the status of the test
back to the main node.  When running distributed, the number of cores specified is the number of cores <em>per worker</em>.
A worker is a single process that is pulling the tests, executing each one and reporting status.</p>
<section id="complexities-of-distributed-execution">
<h2>Complexities of Distributed Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#complexities-of-distributed-execution" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>pytest_mproc</em> requires a common server to handle the creation of a test and result queue and control elements, used
to orchestrate test execution.  The machine that this server runs on must allow incoming connections.  There
are options for where this server can run.  The node hosting the main process (where the tester kicks off the
tests) is indeed one such option. However, for a tester running on a laptop testing across a cloud of device
(as an example), it is unlikely that the nodes in the cloud will be able to call into the tester’s laptop.  Firewall
restrictions will undoubtedly prevent this.   Understand the nature of the system you are using for
distributed testing.</p>
<p>Automated distributed testing, <em>pytest_mproc</em> uses ssh to deploy and execute remote worker tasks.  The test infrastructure
must therefore provide ssh access (passwordless) into the remote nodes.  A configuration file must also be defined
to define the structure of the bundle to be deployed to the worker nodes (discussed later).</p>
<p>Inter-process communication is secure and requires a common authentication token.  For manual deployment to workers,
this token must be shared across all nodes.  Such sharing is up to the user to implement and can be achieved through a
callback to retrieve the authentication token:</p>
<p>This should be called globally, presumably close to the top of your <em>conftest.py</em> file.  If you with not to use
a fixed port for the orchestration server, the tester can also provide a callback for allocating ports (otherwise
if not port is specified, a random free port will be allocated):</p>
</section>
<section id="manual-distributed-execution">
<h2>Manual Distributed Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#manual-distributed-execution" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section documents how to bring up the main node, and then manually bring up workers on (presumably) remote
nodes.</p>
<p>To start the main node, use the “–as-main” command line argument, specifying the port the server will listen on:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>% pytest --as-main &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; ...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When <em>–as-main</em> argument is present, N represents the number of cores to use on each worker when
automated distributed testing is invoked.  This sets up the node as main, responsible for orchestrating test
execution across multiple workers. In this scenario, workers must be started manually.  See
section on automated distributed testing below if desired to run from a single <em>pytest</em> invocation.  In this
scenario, specifying <em>–num-cores</em> here will allow workers to also start on the local node, otherwise no workers
will be invoked under this command (delegated to manual bring-up on other machines/processes)</p>
<p>The host an port specified may also be on a remote machine (see section above on why such a scenario might be needed).
In this case, the orchestration manager must be started manually as well.  The tester can create an application
that calls the main function to start the server:</p>
<p>To start each the worker node, assuming the necessary deployment of test code has been made on the node:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>% pytest --num_cores &lt;N&gt; --as-worker &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, N must be greater than or equal to 1;  multiple workers can be invoked on a single node.
Of course,  multiple worker nodes can be used as well. Each worker will attempt to connect
to the main  node for a period of 30 seconds at which point it gives up and exits with na error.</p>

</ul>
<p>The information provided must be complete to run tests in isolation, without reference to any other local files as
such files will most likely not be available on remote nodes.   Note that any requirements that are installed are
cached so that after first execution, the overhead of <em>pip install</em> will be minimal.</p>
<p>Project configurations are specified in a file with the path to that file specified on the command line via
the <em>–project_structure</em> command line option.  Optionally, if not provided and <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>ptmproc_project.cfg” file
exists in the current working directory of test execution, that file will be used.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>All paths specified in the project configuration file must be relative to the configuration file itself,
and should be at or below the directory level of the configuration file</p>
</div>
<p>Any SSH configuration can be specified programmatically if desired.  This allows for a common ssh username or
credentials specification that is common to remote nodes, so that they need not be specified repeatedly on
command line, for example.  Passwordless ssh with proper authentication key set up is preferred, although a
mechanism to retrieve secrets securely, such as an ssh password, works as well.  The following python functions
provide the API for SSH configuration:</p>
<p>Directories for caching  (e.g., where any test requirements are installed on a per-project-name basis peristently)
as well as the temp directory where bundles are deployed can also be specified, can be configured:</p>
<p>These will be common across all nodes, and thus all nodes must support the directory configuration.</p>

<section id="remote-hosts-specification">
<h2>Remote Hosts Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-hosts-specification" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The remote hosts configuration (which nodes the tests execute) is specified on the command line through
the <em>–remote-worker</em> command line option. The value of this option can take several forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a fixed host specification in the form of “&lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;];optoin1=value1;…”;  the option/value pair can be
repeated to specify multiple remote clients</p></li>
<li><p>a file with line-by-line JSON content specifying the remote host/port and options as specified below; the option
cannot be repeated</p></li>
<li><p>an http end point that returns the remote host/port and options, again in line-by-line format.  The option can
be repeated to specify backup end points as necessary</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Use of a server for managin a cloud of resources is discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p>The format of the http response or in the file is in a line-by-line JSON format.  For example, if I am using pytest
to drive execution from remote hosts against attached Android devices, the content might look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-json notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;host&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;host.name.or.ip&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;arguments&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;device&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;ANDROID_DEVICE1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;argument1&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;value1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;ENV_VAR&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;value1&quot;</span><span class="p">}}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Arguments that are all upper case names will be passed to the remote host as environment variables.  All others will
be passed to pytest as command line options in the form “–&lt;option&gt; &lt;value&gt;” and your pytest must be configured
to add and accept those command line options.  There are a few command line options that are reserved for use
by <em>pytest_mproc</em>:
* <em>cores</em> : specifies the number of cores (worker threads) to instantiate on the remote host;  if not specified
the number of cores specified on the main host command line will be used (see below)
* <em>jump_host</em> : if specified, this host:port pair will be used to add a jump host option when invoking ssh against
the remote host</p>
<section id="interface-pytest-mproc-with-a-cloud">
<h3>Interface <em>pytest_mproc</em> with a Cloud<a class="headerlink" href="#interface-pytest-mproc-with-a-cloud" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hard-coding worker node ip addresses in a file or on a command line is not ideal.  Although it provides a
brut-force method for ensuring viability of distributed testing without much setup, a more dynamic alternative
is needed in most cases.  <em>pytest_mproc</em> provides an interface to interact with an externally developed
http (micro) service as proxy for access into a cloud.  Reservation of resources (and relinquishing those
resources when testing ends) is achieved by exercising this REST-ful interface.</p>
<p>When using an http endpoint, <em>pytest_mproc</em> will do lazy loading of the response.  This is to cover the case where
the request to the endpoint is based on a reservation system that reserves specific resources.  (One example is
using pytest to drive device testing of a mobile or smart device.)  The resource may require
preparation time before returning a resrouce back to the main host, or may only be able to
return a subset of the requested resources until others become available.  In this way, <em>pytest_mproc</em> can
start execution against the available resources while waiting for the others to become available (optimized
execution strategy).</p>
<p>If using a web backend, the first line of json should contain the following (with no return characters of course):</p>
<p>The two optional URLs assume that the reservatio system is session-based and provides a way for <em>pytest_mproc</em> to end
the session, as well as signal that the session is still active. The <em>heartbeat_url”  is a way for *pytest_mproc” to
provide a heartbeat to the session/reservation system that the session is still active (to be provided at at least
a 1Hz rate).  The *end_url</em> is a way for <em>pytest_mproc</em> to signal end of session (allowing the reservation system
to relinquish any resources back to the system).  Both of these will be invoked as simplet GET requests.</p>

<section id="running-the-main-cli">
<h3>Running the Main CLI<a class="headerlink" href="#running-the-main-cli" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Distributed parallel execution from the command line can then be done through a single invocation:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>% pytest --as-main<span class="s2">&quot;, &lt;server_host&gt;:&lt;server_port&gt; --cores 1 -k alg2 --project_structure path/to/project.cfg --remote-worker https://some.endpoint.com/reserver?count=5&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that pytest options not specific to pytest_mproc itself are passed along to the client workers (in this case,
the “-k ale2” is pass along).  The “–cores” option is also passed to the worker client and ignores from the
main server process (aka the main server process that is launched through this command will not execute any
worker threads, leaving all work up to the remote clients).  If “cores” is a part of the options provided for
a remote host as part of its configuration (as described above), it will override the value from this command line
invocation.</p>
<p>Breaking this down, lets say we are testing against Android devices on remote hosts and the https endpoint returns:</p>
<div class="highlight-json notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;host&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;host.name.or.ip1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;arguments&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;DEVICE_SERIAL&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Z02348FHJ&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;default_orientation&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;landscape&quot;</span><span class="p">}}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;host&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;host.name.or.ip2&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;arguments&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;DEVICE_SERIAL&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Z0B983HH1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">&quot;default_orientation&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;portrait&quot;</span><span class="p">}}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then the above command on the server will:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>collect all test cases to be executed (pytest functionality)</p></li>
<li><p>populate a test queue for workers to pull from with these cases</p></li>
<li><p>in parallel, bundle, deploy and execute pytest on the worker threads</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each worker host will:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>collect all test cases to be executed (pytest functionality)</p></li>
<li><p>have DEVICE_SERIAL available in <em>os.environ</em> during execution</p></li>
<li><p>be provided the option <em>default_orientation</em> as given above</p></li>
<li><p>launch with a single worker thread (cores = 1) providing a 1-to-1 worker-host-to-device</p></li>
<li><p>each worker thread start a test loop that pulls each test from the main test queue and executes each test until
the queue is exhausted</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If –cores were specified as 4, then each worker host would launch with 4 parallel worker threads, unless
the https endpoint provided a “cores” option with a different value as an override.</p>

<section id="configuration">
<h2>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Global and node scoped fixtures are maintained through a multirprocessing manager, and require assignemnt of a
port.  Normally, the main process will find a free port (random selection) to use.  This behavior can be
overridden by setting <em>PTMPROC_NODE_MGR_PORT</em> and <em>PTMPROC_GLOBALMGR_PORT</em> envorionment variables to specific
port integger values.</p>
<p>Setting <em>PTMPROC_VERBSE</em> to ‘1’ will spit out a lot of information about whay steps <em>pytest_mproc</em> is taking
to execute.</p>
</section>
<section id="logs-and-artifacts">
<h2>Logs and Artifacts<a class="headerlink" href="#logs-and-artifacts" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>pytest_mproc</em> will collect logs from remote workers and pull hem back to the main host.  By default,
these are collected on the main host in “./artifacts” when running, but the location can be overriden by setting the
environment variable PTMPROC_HOST_ARTIFACTS_DIR.</p>
<p>On the worker nodes (when runing distributed automatically), the environment variable PTMPROC_WORKER_ARTIFACTS_DIR
is set to tell pytest where to find the artifacts dir (absolute path) on the worker host.
Setting this environment variable will
have no effect, it is only read in at the beginning of the program. In other words, the location for workers
is fixed by the program and cannot be changed, and should be used as the top-level
location to store (or copy) artifacts.  Any artifacts collected under this directory will be zipped and pulled
back to:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">$(</span>PTMPROC_HOST_ARTIFACTS_DIR<span class="k">)</span>/Worker-&lt;n&gt;/artifacts.zip
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If not set, “./artifacts” is used for PTMPROC_HOST_ARTIFACTS_DIR.</p>
